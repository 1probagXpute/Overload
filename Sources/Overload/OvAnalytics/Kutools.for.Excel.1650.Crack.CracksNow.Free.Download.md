If you want to spice up your gameplay with some cheats, you can use Cheat Engine, a popular tool that allows you to modify values in memory. Cheat Engine can help you get unlimited resources, god mode, quick production, and more. However, using Cheat Engine may also cause some glitches or crashes, so use it at your own risk.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Cheat Engine in Star Wars: Empire at War - Forces of Corruption on Steam. You will need to download and install Cheat Engine from its official website, and also download a plugin that enables cheat mode in the game. You can find the plugin here[^1^].
 
## Step 1: Launch the game and load your save file
 
Start the game and load your save file or start a new game. You can choose any faction and any difficulty level. Once you are in the game, pause it and minimize it.
 
## Step 2: Launch Cheat Engine and load the plugin
 
Open Cheat Engine and click on the "Select a process to open" button. Find and select "StarWarsG.exe" from the list of processes and click "Open". Then click on the "File" menu and select "Load" or press Ctrl+O. Browse to the folder where you downloaded the plugin and select "TestBuildFOC.CT". Click "Open" again.
 
## Step 3: Activate the cheats you want
 
You will see a list of cheats on the left side of Cheat Engine. You can activate them by checking the boxes next to them. Some of the cheats are:
 
- Minimum Resource: Gives you 70000 credits for each resource type.
- God Mode: Makes your units and buildings invincible.
- Full Shield: Gives your units full shield.
- Quick Production: Makes your units and buildings build instantly.
- Used Global Unit Capacity: Shows how many units you have on the map.
- Minimum Unit Capacity: Sets the minimum number of units you can have on the map (default is 100).

You can also change some of the values by double-clicking on them. For example, you can change the minimum resource amount or the minimum unit capacity.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy the game with cheats
 
Once you have activated the cheats you want, go back to the game and resume it. You will see the effects of the cheats immediately. You can also toggle them on and off by checking or unchecking the boxes in Cheat Engine.
 
Note that some cheats may not work in some situations or may cause some problems. For example, god mode may prevent some scripted events from happening or quick production may cause some lag. Also, using cheats may affect your achievements or multiplayer mode. Therefore, use them wisely and have fun!
